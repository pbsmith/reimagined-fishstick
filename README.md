To-Do-List

This is my first ever application, despite only being a console app I hope to provide a comprehensive user interface and draw from an external database.

I utilized a data access object through the help of the SQL server on my computer to save and edit the list.

I hope to refine it over time and work on the user experience.

## Things on my list:
- Make datetime more specific (add hour and minute)
- Make it so the date has to be more reasonable (within a set range of dates)
- Test extremely long strings for inputs to title and description
- Add a few try/catches to replace pseudo catches in writeline form
